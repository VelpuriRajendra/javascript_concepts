<!--
object literals
    objects the collections of property where propers combination keys and values
    objects are collection of keys and values 
    we can access the object proporties using .notation and []notation

    when your assign a key to variable and try to access using .notation ie will give you undefined
    because when your using .notation the key name expect with in the object
    so we can access using the []notation

    looping an object
    for(var variable in objectName)
    variable is give you the evry key in the object
    we can access what ever we want to

    in the javascript we are using object literals not original objects
    objects comes form object oriented programing language
    but javascript is the functional programing laguage
    object is the instance of a class
