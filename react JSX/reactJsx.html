<!--
jsx does not have the feature reusibility
what is reusibility? 
     if we write a code we can able to use multiple times and places called reusibility
react js devides the content as components as small as possible
components are reusibile javascript code
components are the functions with returning jsx elements to meant for reusibility

react library helps to create the react elements
react dom library helps to assign the react elements to browser body

babel helps to converts the jsx elements to react elements.
react dom library helps to assign the react elements to browser body

styles can be reused with class name

jsx elements are not reused, if you want try create a component and reuse
Comp & SecondComp is the componnet which return jsx elements and should start with Captial letter
the component we are using as a element (custom element) in anethor componnet
one function can return only one thing

if we pass the between the custom elelemt it would be received as a children object in the function parameter brackets
if we pass the data as in the open tag it would be received as a prop object in the function parameter brackets
we can pass array, objects, function in the expression to the function as a props
