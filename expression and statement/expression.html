<!--
which are expression and which are statements?
    arithemetic expressions
    string expressions
    logical expressions
    boolean expression 
    functional call expressions
        parseInt(value)  parseInt() - is the function call & passing a value to function is argument

    expression is returned the value
    statement is to perfom a logic 
        statements are also called expresion statements.

    declaration statements  --- declaring a variable it will not return anything
    function declaration statements
    input statements
    conditional statements  --- if else switch
    control statements -- for while
    iterative statement --  for in, for of
    compond statement -- we can combined multiple statement into a single statement
    {
        console.log("this is compond 1")
        console.log("this is compond 2")
        console.log("this is compond 3")
    }                                      //by using {} we can combines into single statement
    compond statement is also called as a block





    reference error comes when your try to use the not declared variables
