<!--
modules mainly used for to find the issue easily 
we can replace the module or modify the module seperatly without disturbing the total
modules are maintainability 
modules are mainly used for resuibility of javascript code.
we can not use one js file in anethor js 
but we can use both in html file and from there we can use the code in one file to anethor file

so when we are loading files the files load line by line
if  i load main.js first then will get the error beacuase we have our in the utils.js

secong method without mentioning in the html 
direct export from the file and import in the file bt mentionning type module

we can import default exports individual
we can import in the {} direct exports
we can change the names for import for default exports
we no need to maintain a name while exporting a function
