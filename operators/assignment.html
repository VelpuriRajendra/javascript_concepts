<!--

assignment operators are =, +=, -=, *=, /+, %=
ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR is = :
    assignment operator is execute / evaluate the LHS & assigned to the RHS
    100 + 200 = b; always lhs is a variable getting error as invalid LHS syntax error

    swapping 2 numbers

    += :
    a += 10 is explained as a = a + 10 and a is a variable and assigned the evaluated RHS to the LHS
