call,apply and bind is used to executes a function call or a simple function call
and we can manipulate the ths keyword using the above methods

call()
bsically this.ammount pointing to the 100 but we are changing the ammount value to obj so we can pass the objct what we want to point
we can pass in the call method
we can pass arguments by kama seperated

apply()
we can pass the arguments as an array format

bind()
bind also same like call but the diff is the bind return the same function form that returned fun we can call the function
